# Introduction to R Programming

R in commonly used in bioinformatics because of statistical computing capabilities and an extensive collection of packages developed by a large community of scientists.

This notebook will walk you through some of the basics of R programming to help you get started.

# Installation of R and R Studio

Before diving into R programming you will want to have both R and RStudio (interactive development environment) installed. You can download them from the official website <https://docs.posit.co/previous-versions/rstudio/#2023121>.

> *Note: When installing R, it's wise to verify the version you choose, especially if you intend to utilize community-developed packages. For this introduction we will be using version 4.2.0.*

After opening R Studio you will want to create a new notebook and allow R Studio to install the packages needed. We will review the installation of packages later in this tutorial.
