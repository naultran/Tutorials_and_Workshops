# Installation of R and R Studio

Before diving into R programming you will want to have both R and RStudio (interactive development environment) installed. You can download them from the official website <https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/>.

> *Note: When installing R, it's wise to verify the version you choose, especially if you intend to utilize community-developed packages. For this introduction we will be using version 4.3.3.*

After opening R Studio you will want to create a new notebook and allow R Studio to install the packages needed. We will review the installation of packages later in this tutorial.
