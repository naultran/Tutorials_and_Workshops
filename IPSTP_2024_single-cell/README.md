# IPSTP Big Data Bootcamp 2024
Welcome to the hands-on portion for single-cell and spatial analyses for the 2024 Big Data Bootcamp! In these activities we will introduce the basic concepts of downloading, visualizing, and processing single-cell and spatial transcriptomic datasets relevant to Pharmacology and Toxicology applications.

## Getting started!
 This material has been developed specifically for running the on [MSU High Performance Computer Cluster](https://icer.msu.edu) using their [OnDemand](https://ondemand.hpcc.msu.edu/) platform. Prior to this course you should have already been given access to the HPCC and the Bootcamp shared file space.

### 1. Start RStudio Server
In the OnDemand website, click on RStudio Server and choose the following resources:
_R version:_ 4.3.2 (with Bioconductor packages)<br>
_Number of hours:_ 4<br>
_Number of cores per task:_ 4<br>
_Amount of memory:_ 64GB<br>

Leave the remaining options as default and click __Launch__

### 2. Clone this repository into your home space

 ```
 git clone https://github.com/naultran/Tutorials_and_Workshops.git
 cd Tutorials_and_Workshops/IPSTP_2024_single-cell
 ```

### 3. Open notebook file
Using the file menu, open the appropriate notebook (.Rmd) file for the session. Follow the instructions in this file.

For a more friendly look at the material, be sure to click on __Visual__ in the top left corner just above the code.
